#Pi and square root of two
This way of counting Pi and sqrt(2) is not best, but main reason to write this code was to practice groovy closures and spock API.
##How this works:
⋅⋅⋅We try to find best approximation of point p that has only one simple property - integral from 0 to point p is equal 1.
###Lets do this with two functions:
####sin(x)
```y=sin(x)```
in this case p = pi/2
####x
```y=x```
in this case p = sqrt(2)
